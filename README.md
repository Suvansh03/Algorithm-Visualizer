# Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is a 3D visualization tool that demonstrates the step-by-step execution of various sorting algorithms. Built using C++ and OpenGL, the visualizer displays a set of 3D bars that represent the data being sorted. Users can randomize the data and observe how different sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Ripple Sort, perform in real-time.
The key features of this project include:
Visualization of Sorting Algorithms
Displays a 3D bar graph representation of the data being sorted
Animates the step-by-step process of each sorting algorithm
Allows users to observe the differences in performance and behaviour between various sorting algorithms
Interactive User Interface
Provides a user-friendly interface to randomize the data and select the sorting algorithm
Enables users to control the visualization speed and pause/resume the animation
Robust Implementation
Utilizes C++ and OpenGL to create a performant and visually appealing application
Demonstrates strong programming skills in data structures, algorithms, and computer graphics
